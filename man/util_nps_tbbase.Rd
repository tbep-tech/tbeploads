\title{Create unioned base layer for non-point source (NPS) ungaged load estimation in the Tampa Bay watershed}
\usage{
util_nps_tbbase(
  tbsubshed,
  tbjuris,
  tblu,
  tbsoil,
  gdal_path = NULL,
  chunk_size = NULL,
  cast = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbsubshed}{sf object \code{link{tbsubshed}} of major drainage basins in the Tampa Bay watershed}

\item{tbjuris}{sf object \code{link{tbjuris}} of TBNMC jurisdictions in the Tampa Bay watershed}

\item{tblu}{sf object of land use/land cover in the Tampa Bay watershed, currently either \code{link{tblu2020}} or \code{link{tblu2023}}}

\item{tbsoil}{sf object \code{link{tbsoil}} of soil data in the Tampa Bay watershed}

\item{gdal_path}{Character string specifying the path to GDAL binaries (e.g., "C:/OSGeo4W/bin"). If NULL (default), assumes GDAL is in system PATH.}

\item{chunk_size}{Integer. For large datasets, process in chunks of this many features. Set to NULL (default) to process all at once.  This applies only to the final union with the soils data.}

\item{cast}{Logical. If TRUE, will cast multipolygon geometries to polygons before processing. Default is FALSE, which keeps multipolygons as is (usually faster).}
}
\value{
A summarized data frame containing the union of all inputs showing major bay segment, sub-basin (basin), drainage feature (drnfeat), jurisdiction (entity), land use/land cover (FLUCCSCODE), CLUCSID, IMPROVED, hydrologic group (hydgrp), and area in hectures.  These represent all relevant spatial combinations in the Tampa Bay watershed.

Relies heavily on \code{\link{util_nps_union}} to perform the union operations efficiently using GDAL/OGR.
